# VUE Netflix clone

## Description

The aim of this project is to use VUE to make a functional clone of Netflix

## Features

1. The ability to sign in and out
2. A banner that advertises new and upcoming films and series
3. A grid of films and series divided into different genres
4. The ability to add and remove items to a watch list
5. A page for viewing items in your watch list

## MVP

- Ensure that the landing page looks like the Netflix landing page
- Allow users to add and delete movies from the watchlist
- Have a max of 20 movies on the watchlist
- Watchlist movies remain in place even after page refresh
- Search a movie by name or actor's name
- There is no need to include a login page, but we won't stop you if you do

## Backlog

## Future additions

# Original README

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
